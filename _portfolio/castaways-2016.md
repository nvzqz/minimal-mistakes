## Design Choices
- **Heart:** Love for those battling cancer.
- **Paddles:** A Castaway's tools to get to their destination.
- **Seagull:** Inspires hope by being a symbol of life and land nearby. It is a
literal _"Proof of Life"_.

## The Castaways

The Castaways are a rag-tag crew of kayaking enthusiasts who paddle from Miami
to Key West to raise money for the American Cancer Society during their annual
Relay For Life event.

## Documentary

The amazing team at [CCNN Live] followed the Castaways on their 2016 Proof of
Life tour and produced an award-winning documentary.
