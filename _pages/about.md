My name is Nikolai Vazquez and I enjoy creating. I channel my creativity through
software development, graphic design, and music performance.

## Background

I live in Miami, FL however I spend most of my year studying computer science at
Boston University.

I currently have a fascination with [Rust]. It makes writing fast and reliable
code very easy. I've made [some contributions][rust-commits] to the language.
I've also authored [some Rust crates](https://crates.io/users/nvzqz).

In addition to Rust, a great deal of my work is made with [Swift]. I've written
a few libraries [available via CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/owners/8243).

My introduction to software development was through the open source community.
As a result, I prioritize making my code open and freely distributable on
[GitHub][gh].
