My name is Nikolai Vazquez and I enjoy creating. The channels through which I do
this are software, graphic design, and music.

## Background

Currently, I study computer science at Boston University.

I am obsessed with [Rust]. It makes writing fast and reliable code very easy.

My introduction to software development was through the open source community.
As a result, I prioritize making my code open and freely distributable on
[GitHub][gh].

I speak English, hablo español und ich spreche Deutsch.

[gh]: https://github.com/nvzqz
[Rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org
